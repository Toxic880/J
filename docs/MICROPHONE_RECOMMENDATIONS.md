# JARVIS Microphone Recommendations

## Why Microphone Quality Matters

JARVIS uses your microphone for:
- **Wake word detection** ("Jarvis")
- **Voice commands** (continuous speech recognition)
- **Conversation** (back-and-forth dialogue)

A poor microphone leads to:
- ❌ Missed wake words (you say "Jarvis" and nothing happens)
- ❌ Incorrect transcription ("turn on the lights" → "turn off the lights")
- ❌ Frustration and distrust in the system

## Quick Recommendation

**For most users:** [Anker PowerConf S330](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCZPW2) ($50)
- Plug and play USB
- Good noise cancellation
- Works at desk distance (1-2 feet)
- Built-in speaker for JARVIS responses

## The "Alexa Experience" Setup

To get always-listening, far-field performance like an Echo device:

**Recommended:** [ReSpeaker USB Mic Array](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D27DLGY) ($80)

Why:
- **4 microphones** in array (vs. Echo's 7, but close enough)
- **5+ meter range** - works across the room
- **LED ring** - visual feedback (can be programmed)
- **Beamforming** - focuses on your voice, rejects background

Setup:
1. Plug into USB
2. Place in center of room (or mount on wall)
3. In JARVIS settings, select "ReSpeaker" as audio input
4. Increase wake word sensitivity to "High"

## Placement Tips

### Desk Microphone
- Position 6-12 inches from your mouth
- Angle slightly off-center (reduces breath pops)
- Keep away from keyboard and fan vents
- Use a shock mount if you type while talking

### Room Microphone (Alexa-style)
- Place in center of room, chest height
- Away from TV/speakers (echo interference)
- Away from HVAC vents (noise)
- Clear line-of-sight to where you usually are

## Audio Settings in JARVIS

After installing a good microphone, optimize JARVIS settings:

1. **Settings → Audio → Test Microphone**
   - Run the analysis
   - Check your SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
   - Target: >20 dB for good, >30 dB for excellent

2. **Wake Word Sensitivity**
   - Desk mic: Medium
   - Room mic: High
   - If false triggers: Lower to Low

3. **Noise Gate**
   - Enable if you have persistent background noise
   - Set threshold just above your noise floor

4. **Echo Cancellation**
   - Keep ON if JARVIS speaks through the same device
   - Can turn OFF if using separate speaker

## Troubleshooting

### "Jarvis doesn't hear me"

1. Check microphone is selected in JARVIS settings
2. Run microphone test - is there audio?
3. Check system volume/gain isn't too low
4. Try saying "Jarvis" more clearly, with pause after
5. Increase wake word sensitivity

### "Jarvis triggers randomly"

1. Lower wake word sensitivity
2. Enable noise gate
3. Check for TV/radio that might say "Jarvis"
4. Avoid placing mic near speakers

### "My words get transcribed wrong"

1. Speak more slowly and clearly
2. Reduce background noise
3. Position mic closer to mouth
4. Try a better microphone (see recommendations)

### "Feedback loop / echo"

1. Enable Echo Cancellation in settings
2. Use headphones for JARVIS responses
3. Lower JARVIS volume
4. Position mic away from speakers
